# Hello Image Classification

This basic introduction to OpenVINOâ„¢ shows how to do inference with an image classification model.

A pre-trained [MobileNetV3 model](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/blob/master/models/public/mobilenet-v3-small-1.0-224-tf/README.md) from [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo/) is used in this tutorial. For more information about how OpenVINO IR models are created, refer to the [TensorFlow to OpenVINO](../tensorflow-classification-to-openvino/tensorflow-classification-to-openvino.ipynb) tutorial.
